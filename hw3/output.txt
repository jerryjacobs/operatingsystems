Once
when
Lion
was
asleep
little
Mouse
began
running
up
and
down
upon
him
this
soon
wakened
the
Lion
who
placed
his
huge
paw
upon
him
and
opened
his
big
jaws
to
swallow
him
Pardon
King
cried
the
little
Mouse
forgive
me
this
time
shall
never
forget
it
who
knows
but
what
may
be
able
to
do
you
turn
some
of
these
days
The
Lion
was
so
tickled
at
the
idea
of
the
Mouse
being
able
to
help
him
that
he
lifted
up
his
paw
and
let
him
go
Some
time
after
the
Lion
was
caught
in
trap
and
the
hunters
who
desired
to
carry
him
alive
to
the
King
tied
him
to
tree
while
they
went
in
search
of
wagon
to
carry
him
on
Just
then
the
little
Mouse
happened
to
pass
by
and
seeing
the
sad
plight
in
which
the
Lion
was
sent
up
to
him
and
soon
gnawed
away
the
ropes
that
bound
the
King
of
the
Beasts
Was
not
right
said
the
little
Mouse
